## Why Accessibility Matters

* **Inclusivity**: Everyone deserves equal access to information and functionality
* **Legal compliance**: Many regions have laws requiring digital accessibility (ADA, WCAG, EAA)
* **Business benefits**: Larger audience reach, better SEO, improved user experience for everyone

## Key Accessibility Principles

### Semantic HTML

Using the right HTML elements for their intended purpose:

```html
<!-- Instead of this -->
<div class="button" onclick="submitForm()">Submit</div>

<!-- Use this -->
<button type="submit">Submit</button>
```

### ARIA Attributes

When HTML isn't enough, ARIA helps provide context:

```html
<div role="alert" aria-live="assertive">
  Form submitted successfully!
</div>
```

### Keyboard Navigation

Ensure all interactive elements are accessible without a mouse:

```css
:focus {
  outline: 2px solid #4a90e2;
}
```

Building with accessibility in mind from the start is always easier than retrofitting it later. By following established guidelines like WCAG, you can create experiences that work well for everyone.
