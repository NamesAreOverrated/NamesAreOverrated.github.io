CSS has evolved tremendously over the years, providing web developers with powerful tools to create stunning and responsive designs with less effort.

## CSS Grid Layout

CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that revolutionizes how we design web layouts:

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(250px, 1fr));
  gap: 20px;
}
```

## CSS Custom Properties (Variables)

Variables in CSS allow you to define reusable values:

```css
:root {
  --main-color: #6200ee;
  --secondary-color: #03dac6;
}

.button {
  background-color: var(--main-color);
  color: white;
}
```

## CSS Animations and Transitions

Create smooth, hardware-accelerated animations:

```css
.card {
  transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out;
}

.card:hover {
  transform: translateY(-10px);
}
```

These techniques will help you build more maintainable, efficient, and visually appealing websites that stand out in today's competitive web landscape.
