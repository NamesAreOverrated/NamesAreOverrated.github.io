## React's Strengths

* **Flexibility**: React is more of a library than a framework, giving you freedom in how you structure your application
* **Large ecosystem**: Extensive libraries, tools, and community support
* **JSX**: Combines HTML and JavaScript in a way that can make components more intuitive

```jsx
function Welcome() {
  return <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
}
```

## Vue's Strengths

* **Gentle learning curve**: Often easier for beginners to pick up
* **Comprehensive documentation**: Well-organized and thorough guides
* **Template-based syntax**: More familiar to traditional web developers

```vue
<template>
  <h1>{{ greeting }}</h1>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      greeting: 'Hello, world!'
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

## Which Should You Choose?

Consider your team's experience, project requirements, and long-term goals. Both frameworks are excellent choices with active development and community support.

The best framework is ultimately the one that helps your team deliver quality products efficiently.
